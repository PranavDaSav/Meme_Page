<h1>This is a Meme Page</h1>
<p style="color:Blue"> This is a list of Memes. I myslef am a Meme.<br>
basciclly when you get depressed like me,<br> the only
cure are memes. So this is a meme page or a meme <br> randomisier(I don't
kno how to spel somtimes) but I thought that <br>meme page
sounded cooler. Choose the genre of memes you want, <br>
if what you want is not on this. Well, that sucks completely. </p>
